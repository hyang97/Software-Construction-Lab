Week 6 Homework:
1. Since the sessions are symmetrically encrypted, a third party looking at the
bytes would essentially see gibberish instead of the actual commands being
communicated. If the other teams observed my team's keystrokes, then they would
have access to the passwords and passphrases we used, as well as all the
commands we sent during the session. If it's just the keystrokes, the files and
content we send would be fine as they're still encrypted with the private key.
If the other teams had physical access to the USBs we used to boot our operating
system, then our communications would be compromised because the private key
would be stored on the USB and they could use it to decrypt the communications.

2. gpg --verify would only verify that the exact content of the document sent
matches the one that the sender intended. The command does this by decrypting
the signature, generating the message digest from the derived documents, and
then comparing the decrypted signature with the generated message digest to
ensure they're the same. In order to ensure that the signer of the message is
truly the sender, make sure that in the private-public key matching that gpg
--verify does, the public key actually belongs to the sender. Essentially,
verify that the sender's public key decrypts the signature to generate the same
message digest the one created from the received documents.
