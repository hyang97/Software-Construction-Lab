Week 8 Lab


Setup:

- generated random file filled with 10 million randomly generated floating point
  numbers
- used the following command:
  od -An -t f8 -N 80000000 < /dev/urandom | tr -s ' ' '\n' > random.txt
- od stands for octal dump, essentially takes an input and writes it to standard
  output in octal form
- -An set file offset to none, -t f8 specified the format to be floating point
  numbers taking up 8 bytes each, -N 80000000 means the output is limited to 80
  million bytes, which translates to 10 million double precision floating point
  numbers
- the output is piped through tr, which replaces all space characters with
  newline characters, and the output is directed into the file random.txt

Timing sort

timing single threaded execution:
- command: time -p sort -g < random.txt > /dev/null
- result:
real 39.75
user 203.96
sys 0.43

timing multi-threaded execution:
- command: time -p sort -g --parallel=N < random.txt > /dev/null
- note: in the command above, replace N with 1, 2, 4, 8 for number of threads
- results:

1 thread
real 177.07
user 176.92
sys 0.22

2 threads
real 95.36
user 182.53
sys 0.24

4 threads
real 59.77
user 191.96
sys 0.35

8 threads
real 40.87
user 205.89
sys 0.43
