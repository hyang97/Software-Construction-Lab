Week 4 Laboratory: Change Management

- git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/diffutils.git to get the files from the
  git repository
- git log > git-log.txt --> piped the log output data into text file
- git tag > git-tags.txt --> piped the git tags into text file
- used C-s to jump to the commit with the multiple instances of "like this"
- copied the hash value and used git show to get the patch data from the commit,
  piped the patch data into a file called quote-patch.txt
- used git checkout v3.0 -b newbranch to create a new branch that points at the
  commit called v3.0, moved to newbranch
- before applying check, we reproduce the bug on this branch by calling
  ./src/diff . -, and seeing that the error message produced has `-'
- applied patch using patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt
- skipped all the files that the program was unsure about patching
- git status showed a list of all the files that were modified
- in order to make sure the impact of the patch was minimal and only affected
  the files that were necessary, each modified file was inspected using vc-diff
- the non c files were reverted entirely using vc-revert in emacs
- the hunks in the c files that contained changes in comments were reverted,
  since those were not strictly necessary changes to  make
- inspected the .rej files to see which changes failed, and applied the changes
  if they were imported - if they were changes from ` to ' in code
- removed untracked files, but saved the files to be turned in elsewhere before
  deleting
- used git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt to generate clean patch, inspected to see
  it was 327 lines
- used ./bootstrap, ./configure, make, and then make check as specified by
  README-hacking
- ran the command ./src/diff . - and saw that the error message did not contain
  ` -- success!!!!
- ./src/diff --help was successful as well!
- staged all the modified files using git add
- copied the quote-3.0-patch.txt file somewhere safe and cleaned it away
- git commit -m 'clean patch' to commit the changes
- created new directories diffutils-3.0 and diffutils-3.0-patch using mkdir
- copied the src file for diff into diffutils-3.0-patch while still on
  newbranch, and then moved to the commit v3.0 to move the src file for diff
  into diffutils-3.0
- ran the line ./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch
  >quote-3.0-test.txt while in the directory containing the source fill
  directory as well as the diffutils directory
- used diff to find the difference between quote-3.0-test.txt and
  quote-3.0-patch.txt, and piped the result into patchdiff.txt
- upon inspection, there are differences between quote-3.0-test.txt and
  quote-3.0-patch.txt, but that is simply because quote-3.0-test.txt contains
  information from both the unpatched and patched source code, while
  quote-3.0-patch.txt merely contains the required changes
