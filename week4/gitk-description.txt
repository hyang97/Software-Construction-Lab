Gitk Description

There are 5 windows present in the screenshot. The top 3 subwindows describe
information about various commits. Going right from left, the first window
visualizes the branching of the commits along with the commit name. The second
window shows the author of the commit. The third window displays the date of the
commit, and it is in this window where I found the newest commit that is not
newer than 2015-1-25. On the bottom half of the display, there are two
windows. Going from left to right, the first window displays the changelog as
well as the changes made by the commit in a similar format as the output of
diff. The second window is lists the files that are affected by the commit.
