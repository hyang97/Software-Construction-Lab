Week 4 Homework: Verifying and publishing a backported change

- use the command git checkout v3.0 -b quote to checkout v 3.0 into a new branch
  called quote
- applied patch using patch -p1 < ~/cs35l/week4/quote-3.0-patch.txt
- opened each of the 6 files and used the command C-x 4 a to create a new
  changelog file and record the changes
- git add to stage the modified files
- git commit to commit staged changes - used the ChangeLog as the message for
  the commit
- used command git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt to create a
  patch including 1 recent commit
- used scp to trade files with partner, I traded with Jeremiah Fan, 704632449
- created new branch partner with v3.0
- applied patch using git am
- build and test using ./bootstrap, ./configure, make, and make check
- behaved similarly to original patch
- sanity check - did ./src/diff . - just to see that ` isn't being used
- ran make distdir and inspected diffutils*/ChangeLog
- Jeremy's patch succeeded in every single way
- repeated the commands make distdir and inspected diffutils*/ChangeLog for the
  quote branch to ensure my ChangeLog was working - it is
-
