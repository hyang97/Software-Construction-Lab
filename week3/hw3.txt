Week 3: Modifying and Rewriting Software

1. The line "case_long_iso_time_style:" was a goto marker to a redundant case in
the switch statement, since "case long_iso_time_style:" was already there. Removing
"case_long_iso_time_style" cleans up the code by getting rid of the unnecessary
line, since we removed the goto line. 
2. By adopting this patched version of coreutils, we just use the traditional
UNIX format for displaying date. This might be problematics if other programs
expect different formats for dates since we force the traditional UNIX format,
such as in other countries that display month and day in different orders.
3. When an empty file is passed in as the argument, the program will fail with
a list index out of range error. Since the self.lines reads all the lines from
the file, and the file is empty, self.lines will have 0 length. The random class
function will return IndexError if the list is empty, which is exactly what
happened here.
4. In python 3, automatic tuple unpacking was removed so the line "except IO
error as (errno, strerror):" throws an error for invalid syntax. In 2.7, the
tuple (errno, strerror) is automatically evaluated, but this is not the case
anymore in python 3.
