Week 3 Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

- moved extracted coreutils files into my working directory
- created exec folder to hold all of the installed executables called exec 
- ran configure with the argument
  --prefix="/u/cs/ugrad/ziheny/cs35l/week3/coreutils-7.6/exec" 
- configure creates the make file that installs executables into exec
- ran make, make install
- cd into exec/bin and then ran ls executable to reproduce the bug
- specifically ran "./ls -l ~/" to see the bug 
- cd into coreutils-7.6/src
- opened emacs to edit ls.c
- C-s and found the first change to make according to Brady's workaround
- changed all the lines, saved and exit
- cd into coreutils-7.6 and ran make, which recompiled the modified ls.c
- significant lines:
CC ls.o --> recompiled the changed file using gcc
CCLD dir, CCLD vdir, CCLD ls --> updated files that have connection to changed
ls.c file
GEN dir.1, GEN vdir.1, GEN ls.1 --> updating man pages
all other lines recursively went into all the relevant directories for the make
file, found there was nothing to be done, and popped out of the recursion
- in folder coreutils-7.6, ran the following lines
./src/ls -l ~/ --> for patched executable
./exec/bin/ls -l ~/ --> for not patched executable
- it works perfectly fine for files older than one year and younger than one
  year - used the /bin directory for some older files
- newer files show the hour/minute, older files show year
- old executable does not work as intended
